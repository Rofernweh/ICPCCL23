# ICPCCL23 Competitive programming bootcamp

Welcome to the Contest Repository! This repository contains all the contest problems we solved during our intensive 9-day bootcamp. Below, you will find a brief overview of the ICPC competition and how the bootcamp helped us sharpen our algorithmic and C++ programming skills.

## About ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an annual competitive programming competition for university students from around the world. Teams of three members collaborate to solve a set of challenging algorithmic problems within a limited time frame. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, making it an excellent platform for honing programming abilities.

## Bootcamp Experience

The bootcamp was an intensive 9-day program designed to elevate our competitive programming skills and enhance our proficiency in C++. Throughout the bootcamp, we participated in mock ICPC-style contests, allowing us to apply the knowledge and techniques we reviewed on that particular day to solve complex algorithmic problems. Thanks to that we improved our ability to craft efficient and elegant solutions.

Key objectives of the bootcamp:

- **Algorithmic Problem Solving:** We were exposed to a wide variety of algorithmic problems, ranging from classical to advanced topics, which allowed us to develop a deep understanding of various algorithmic techniques.

- **Teamwork and Collaboration:** The bootcamp emphasized teamwork and collaboration, encouraging us to work in teams to tackle problems efficiently and effectively.

- **Optimized C++ Coding:** We focused on writing efficient and bug-free C++ code, learning about common used libraries and advanced C++ techniques to optimize our solutions.

- **Time Management:** The bootcamp challenged us to manage our time effectively during contests, enabling us to make the most of the time to solve problems fast.

- **Problem Analysis and Debugging:** We learned how to analyze problems and devise appropriate strategies to approach them. Additionally, we honed our debugging skills to identify and fix errors in our code swiftly.

PS: I'm looking for the original source of each problem, also looking for as many resources related to the individual problems as possible, if you have any material or suggestion feel free to let me know. 

The solution files were provided by me, if you have any suggestion for a better approach, open an issue or send me a pull request directly, I'm open for any help :).

And finally get comfy, and explore the problem folders in this repository solve them as you progress, and if you get troubled on any, just look the resources to find the solutions and explanations for each one.

Happy coding and happy learning! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
