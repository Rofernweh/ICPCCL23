## Day 5: Dynamic Programming 
This day we were introduced to the concept of dynamic programming, which is a technique to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and then solving them. This is a very powerful technique that can be used to solve many problems, but it is not always easy to identify when it can be used.
