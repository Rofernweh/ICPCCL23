## Day 3: Basic Algorithms
This day we review basic algorithms such as sorting, binary search, pointers, sliding window and greedy. We also learned about some of the most common problems that can be solved using these algorithms and data structures, such as finding the <strong>k</strong>th smallest element in an array, finding the median of an array, and finding the number of inversions in an array.
