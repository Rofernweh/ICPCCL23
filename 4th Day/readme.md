## Day 4: Graphs (Supposed to be Segment tree)
This day we were introduced to graphs and some of their properties. We also learned about some of the most common graph algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc. We also learned about some of the most common graph problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes, and finding the number of connected components in a graph.
